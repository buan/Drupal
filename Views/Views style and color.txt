In views we want to achieve 

Views style add color.xlsx

Steps
1)Add the content types :Eatable Items
2)Add 3 fields:
    Title=>text
    Body=>text
    Food Type=>term reference

3) Add taxonomy term: Food Type and add 3 names
        1)Fruits
        2)Vegetables
        3)Flowers

4)  Create a view named Eatable Items
     a)Select table as format
     b)Add fields
            Content:Title
            (term) Taxonomy term: Name (fooditems):
                    For this make a relationship with taxonomy name(here food type) and fields. make this field hidden
    c)Select Global text:Go to the text field and write html using tokens available as replacement patterns. in our case we write 
    
    This falls under the category <strong class="myitem-[name]">[name]</strong>

    In order to make the css different for each taxonomy we add myitem-{{taxonomy name}} as the css and apply corresponding  css there for each content type

    strong.myitem-Flowers {
    color: red;
}

strong.myitem-Fruits {
    color: yellow;
}

strong.myitem-Vegetables {
    color: green;
}

like this

Put filter criteria as published=yes and type=Eatable items

No other changes are required. The taxonomy word changes to the corresponding color
